# This blog now features comments

I've add the Github powered comments via [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/). 

I followed this [blog post here](https://abba.dev/blog/blog-comments-with-utterances). It's all pretty straightforward, you can see [my implementation here](https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/edab89b8d02b5eba0bddfeef23fe1c2e09b3f7b1/app/components/PostComments/PostComments.tsx). 

What a fantastic tool. It took all of about 10-15 minutes to set up.
