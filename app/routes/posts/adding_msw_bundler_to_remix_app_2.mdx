In the [previous post](./adding_msw_bundler_to_remix_app) I outlined how to make use of mdx-bundler to access your frontmatter metadata. This approach requires file system access as the files are parsed at run time. 

In this post, we'll we'll talk about how to achieve the same effect for use in a serverless platform, such a Netlify or AWS Lambda. 

The solution essentially involves a build time step that extracts the frontmatter to JSON files. These JSON files can then be read at run time. 

## This solution is for Remix V1

This solution is for Remix V1. The reason is because V2 made changes to Remix's routing - and got rid of nested routing. 

That is, where in V1 we can organise our routing like: 

```
/app 
   /routes 
       /posts
          blogpost1.mdx
          blogpost2.mdx
      /drafts
          draftpost1.mdx
       posts.tsx 
       some_other_page.tsx

```

Remix V2 got rid of the ability to use file/folder nesting to determine the URL, the equivalent solution would look like: 


```
/app 
   /routes 

      posts.blogpost1.mdx
      posts.blogpost2.mdx
      drafts.draftpost1.mdx
      posts.tsx 
      some_other_page.tsx

```

For potentially hundreds of files this would get quite messy. 

(However, I concede that this is potentially something I could live with). 

Also note that I don't want to do a 'store the blog posts in a database' solution. This is [something that is recommended in Remix's documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/mdx#example:~:text=Clearly%20this%20is,MDX%20Bundler.) but I don't agree with the reasoning. In my opinion two of the major advantages of using a Github-hosted-MDX-files solution is that you provide a convenient way of allow viewers to submit edit requests, and it provides a handy version history.
