# How to configure Remix and mdx-bundler

<InfoPanel level="warning">
<p>The MDX Bundler solution requires server-side file system access, and as such is not suitable for serverless application deployments using services like AWS Lambda or Netlify.</p>
</InfoPanel>

This post outlines a process I took to improve this blog, although I ultimately abandoned this approach due to the requirement to have access to the file system.

## Starting Point

Initially I had followed [Remix's MDX guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/mdx). 

We declare `.mdx` files in our Remix routing structure. Remix's out-of-the-box tooling can handle the the MDX content and at build time converts it to JavaScript where it is treated just like any other ordinary React route component. 

Conveniently, [YAML frontmatter](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-yaml-frontmatter) headers are also supported. 

Some configuration was required - to add codeblock syntax highlighting, for example.

## The Problem

The problem I had is mostly around the usage of frontmatter - I had no control of how the frontmatter behaved with my application; I could only use the functionality as provided with the out-of-the-box tooling - adding titles, social meta tags etc. 

One annoying issue I had was that twitter's social meta tags required their own `twitter` prefix (eg. `og:twitter:title`), even though this was going to be the exact same as the other socials, [I had to go through and specially add frontmatter items for twitter on every post](https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/pull/60/files).

But mostly, I wanted to be able to group items in a series - and provide links to the next item in the series etc, all without having to maintain those links everywhere. 

Note the nice series box at the top of this page. 

Additional functionality might include including an author tag and creation dates. 

## The Solution 

A recommended solution [by Remix themselves](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/mdx#mdx) is to use [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). 

At first I looked at how [Kent C. Dodds' builds his blog](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com). But his configuration is _complex_ (eg. [see here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/e488c740c83da7979adb1fd2366a7933df4a213d/app/utils/mdx.tsx)). 

One of the top search results for 'remix mdx-bundler' gives us [this Oldweb2 blog post](https://blog.oldweb2.com/remix-mdx-blog), which is a lot simpler. However, this post is quite out of date. However, it was a useful starting point in understanding the general strategy of using mdx-bundler. 

This solution is for Netlify and Remix 1.x.x. 


### Move all of your MDX files out of the routes directory 

You are no longer going to use Remix's out-of-the-box file routing for the blog posts. I moved all my posts from `~/app/routes/posts/blog_post.mdx` to `~/app/blog-posts/posts/blog_post.mdx`. 

### Update your TSConfig if you haven't already 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/020ff44a2b20db79aab9b47f04ccc91554a26056/tsconfig.json#L10-L11"/>

The `module` property will allow us to do dynamic imports later. 

### Declare .server.ts utility files 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/020ff44a2b20db79aab9b47f04ccc91554a26056/app/utils/fs.server.ts#L1-L3"/>

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/020ff44a2b20db79aab9b47f04ccc91554a26056/app/utils/mdx.server.ts#L1-L3"/>

The [`.server.ts` file convention](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/-server) causes Remix to not include this code in client bundles - which is important as these use node packages. 

### Create a post.tsx utility for parsing the MDX. 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/c34a3a39992e38f50b8409d3dbcf549801556496/app/utils/post.tsx#L1-L110"/>

### Create a slug handler

### Update a pages metadata based on frontmatter

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/a600d7602d42733909890cc0bcd9cc2bd17a32cf/app/routes/$.tsx#L17-L28"/>

### Create home page list of blog posts

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/afbc9a277dff3518b96db345dee6ad9c0c2d4a0e/app/routes/index.tsx#L7-L38"/>

And there you have it!
