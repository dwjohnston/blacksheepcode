# git checkout interactive

If you've ever found yourself doing something like running

```
git branch --sort=-committerdate

```

(and you've probably got that command aliased) and then using the mouse to select the branch you're using, and then copy pasting that branch into the terminal for the command

```
git checkout <the branch name>
```

I have good news for you. 

[git-checkout-interactive](https://github.com/cookpete/git-checkout-interactive) is a fantastic tool that gives you branch switching logic all from the keyboard. 


Just run `gci` and the use the arrow keys to select the branch you need, and voil√†!

This tool has made my life so much better, I don't know why I didn't google for it earlier.
