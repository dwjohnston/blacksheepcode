# Why I don't like module mocks, kinda. 

Let's say we have an application that looks like this: 

```javascript
//index.ts
import { a } from "./a";

function main() {

    a(); 
}

// a.ts

import { b } from "./b";

export function a() {
   const ids = ["1", "2","3"];    
   
   const result = b(ids); 

   console.log(result);
}

//b.ts
import { c } from "./c";

export function b(ids: Array<string>) : Array<string> {

    return ids.map((v) => {
        return `Item: '${v}', value: '${c(v)}'`
    }); 
}

//c.ts
export function c(id: string) : number {
    return Math.random();
}

```

Pretty straightforward, and contrived. Function a is responsible for knowing the list of IDs, and getting a list of formatted strings from b, and printing them. 
B is responsible for getting the values from C, and formatting them into a string. 
C is responsible for determining the value of a given ID, which in this case is just `Math.random()`. 

So how would we test this? 


# Approach 0 no mocking at all

We could use absolutely no mocking. 

```typescript 
import { a } from "./a"
import fs from "fs";
describe(a, () => {
    it("Outputs 3 lines into the output folder", () => {

        // Run the function 
        a(); 

        // Read the output file 
        const data = fs.readFileSync("output/report.txt"); 
        const text = data.toString(); 

        const lines = text.split("\n"); 
        expect(lines).toHaveLength(3); 


        // Expect the lines to match a regex
        lines.forEach((v) => {
            expect(v).toMatch(/Item: '(\d+)', value: '(\d+\.\d+)'/);             
            
        });
    })
})
```

I absolutely hate this, to the point that I almost didn't include it as an example. 

There's two difficulties. One is that `a()` writes to a file, and so in order to see the output, we need to read that file. 
The other is that the `c()` is uses random, so we can't know what the values are going to be. 


# Approach 1 - Module mocking

So lets solve both of those problems making use of Jest's [module mocking functionality](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks). 

We first declare a module mock for the `fs` module. 

```javascript
//__mocks__/fs.js

'use strict';

const path = require('path');
const fs = jest.createMockFromModule('fs')


fs.writeFileSync= jest.fn();
module.exports = fs;
```

And in our test, we inform jest to use that mock, as well as spying on the global Math.random function 

```javascript
import { a } from "./a"

import fs from "fs";
// Inform jest that we want to use the 
jest.mock('fs');

describe(a, () => {
    it("Outputs 3 lines into the output folder", () => {


        jest.spyOn(global.Math, 'random').mockReturnValueOnce(0.1).mockReturnValueOnce(0.2).mockReturnValueOnce(0.3);
        // Run the function 
        a(); 

        const expectedText =`Item: '1', value: '0.1'
Item: '2', value: '0.2'
Item: '3', value: '0.3'`
        expect(fs.writeFileSync).toHaveBeenCalledWith("./output/report.txt",expectedText)


    })
})
```

There's a quite a few things I don't like about this. 

1. Just a niggle, but I don't like the inconsistency of how we mock the global functions (eg. Math.random), and how we mock native modules. 

2. Big one. It's too easy to 

3. What if there were greater levels of nesting before our Math.random? When we're writing our tests we don't know what non-deterministic modules are being used. 
What if we changed the implementation of C such that it called an API to determine the value? The developer making that change might not realise that a test for a function all the way up the call stack is going to break. 


## Approach - Mocking B

In approach 3 - instead of mocking Math.random we mock the function B. 

```javascript
import { a } from "./a"
import { b } from "./b";
import fs from "fs";
// Inform jest that we want to use the 
jest.mock('fs');
jest.mock("./b");


const mockB = jest.mocked(b); 
mockB.mockReturnValue(["some message1", "some message2", "some message3"]);


describe(a, () => {
    it("Outputs 3 lines into the output folder", () => {


        a();

        const expectedText = `some message1
some message2
some message3`
        expect(fs.writeFileSync).toHaveBeenCalledWith("./output/report.txt", expectedText)


    })
})
```

I like this approach better. We still need to mock fs.writeFileSync, because A uses that directly. But we no longer need to know the specific details of how B formats the data, or how it gets the values.
