In the [previous post](./generating_apps_from_openapi_part8) we dockerised our application. 

In this post we'll get the Docker image running on AWS ECS using CDKTF. 

Later, we'll performance test the application, and then start looking at how we can make improvements. 

## The AWS infrastructure 

We'll run a fairly standard AWS infrastructure for a web application. 

The components are: 

- AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  - A logically isolated network. Essentially see it as a 'grouping' where we can configure how things in the group can talk to each other, and we can otherwise control traffic in or out of the group. 
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
  - Allows running containers on AWS Fargate. 
- AWS Application Load Balancer (ABS) 
  - Essentially acts as nginx - routes traffic to right places, in this case our ECS service. 
- AWS Cloudfront
  - A Content Delivery Network (CDN). Provides edge caching for your resources, as well as provides us a handy HTTPS URL to see our application on. 

We're not using an S3 bucket for our frontend assets right now. We're going to create the application like this, do load testing with [k6](https://k6.io/) and later we'll add an S3 bucket and show how it improves performance. 


## CDKTF

We're using [CDKTF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf) as our infrastructure-as-code solution.  

Install CDKTF via the [instructions here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli). 

## The source material 

I've used this repository as a guide for getting started: 

https://github.com/cdktf/docker-on-aws-ecs-with-terraform-cdk-using-typescript

This example appears to be a little out of date, and so I've massaged it and come up with this. 

Note also, I've removed the S3 bucket, and Postgres database. 

The final product looks like this: 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/infra/main2.ts#L1-L574"/>

I'm not going to go through each part, this'll perhaps be a post for another time, but I'll point out some things. 

## Building the Docker image

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/infra/main2.ts#L107-L138"/>

This is the logic that determines a unique tag for our docker image, based on the contents of what is going into the Docker image. 

The idea here is that if the contents of the application haven't changed, then we don't need to go through with building and pushing the Docker image. 

So we create content hashes of all of the requisite pieces, and then because a string concatenation of those will be too long, we then create a hash from that long string. 

This solution is a little ugly, it would be nice to just declare the entire directory. Problem is, that leads to an recursive loop when it encounters to the cdktf.out directory - see my [Stack Overflow question addressing this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77965204/is-there-a-way-to-exclude-a-folder-from-a-terraformasset).


## Running 

We make sure we've got `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables set. 

We run 

```
cdtkf deploy infra
```

first run this may take several minutes, but eventually we should see: 

```

```

Now we can access our application on that URL and see our deployed application!
