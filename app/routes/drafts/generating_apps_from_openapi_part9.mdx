In the [previous post](./generating_apps_from_openapi_part8) we dockerised our application. 

In this post we'll get the Docker image running on AWS ECS using CDKTF. 

Later, we'll performance test the application, and then start looking at how we can make improvements. 

## The AWS infrastructure 

We'll run a fairly standard AWS infrastructure for a web application. 

The components are: 

- AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- AWS Application Load Balancer (ABS) 
- AWS Cloudfront

We're not using an S3 bucket for our frontend assets right now. We're going to create the application like this, do load testing with [k6](https://k6.io/) and later we'll add an S3 bucket and show how it improves performance.
