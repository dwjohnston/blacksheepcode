# Dockerising our application

We're need to dockerise our application to run it on AWS ECS. 

Let's look at how we do that: 

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

Let's walk through some individual parts of this: 

#### Build frontend 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/Dockerfile#L1-L7"/>

Here, we use a use a docker container to build our frontend resources.

The reason we do this is so that the artifact builds consistently across machines - we don't want a situation where an image build on my machine is different to an image built on someone else's machine. 

Note also the: `FROM --platform=linux/amd64` clause - this avoids an issue where if you build the image on Apple Silicon, it's unable to run on regular amd64 architecture. See this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74731135/1068446).

Note also that we first copy the package.json and package-lock.json and do the install and _then_ we copy the rest of the application code and build the frontend. 

The reason for this is [Docker layer caching](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/) chances are, the dependencies (package.json and package-lock.json) aren't going to change, and so docker doesn't need to re-download the dependencies - it just uses the existing cached layer. 

#### Build backend 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/Dockerfile#L9-L15"/>

The backend build is much the same. We use the same technique of allowing docker the cache the dependencies layer before copying and compiling from the source files. 

#### Build the Docker image 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/Dockerfile#L20-L28"/>

Here we: 

1. Install the requisite dependencies the docker image needs
2. Copy our built artifacts across
3. Copy our nginx and supervisord configs across
4. Expose port 80
5. Start supervisord running 

##### supervisord

We're using supervisord because our docker application needs to two processes: 

1. The go application
2. nginx for routing backend traffic to the go application, and all other traffic to our static resources. 

We use supervisord as [suggested in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/#use-a-process-manager).

Our supervisord.conf looks like this: 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/supervisord.conf#L1-L18"/>

There's not much to it. We do need to add those lines `stdout_logfile` lines to tell supervisord to redirect the process logs to the containers std out. 

##### nginx 

Our nginx config is a pretty standard one 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/nginx.conf#L1-L48"/>

The important part is here: 

<GithubPermalink permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/blob/bf2bae791464a7ce0506d3b91102212ed0beeb3d/nginx.conf#L33-L41"/>

 where we redirect anything starting with `/api` to the go application, and everything else to the static resources directory. 

### Isn't a bad idea to serve your frontend from a Docker container? 

Yes. 

Putting our static assets in S3 bucket, and then serving them via a CDN is likely to a bit a lot faster, and cheaper. 

However, there's two reasons we're doing this, for now: 

1. Having a single image to run anywhere, can be convenient. Imagine this was some kind of internal tool, where performance isn't likely to be a problem, and we were sending this to a client. It's a lot easier to send them a single Docker image and tell them to run it however they want, rather than sending them a Docker image + a archive of static assets and tell them to glue it together themselves. 

2. We're later going to start performance testing our application using [k6](https://k6.io/). I want to demonstrate the performance gains to be had by putting the static assets in an S3 bucket. 

### Building the image

We build the image with: 


```
	docker build -t openapi-go-and-typescript .
```

### Running the image 

We run the image with: 

```
	docker run -p 80:80 openapi-go-and-typescript
```

Now we can access our application on `localhost:80` and voila! A running application!
