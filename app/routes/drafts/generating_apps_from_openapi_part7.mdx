# Black box contract testing - third party API mocking 

What if our application interacts with a third party API (eg. Stripe, Sendgrid, etc). Our black box tests run against a real running application, albiet with an in-memory database, but we don't want it to making real API calls - we likely want to the mock the behaviour of our third party API so our tests can run in a deterministic manner. 

## Updating our application to include a third party application. 

Let's update our application to include some kind of third party interaction. 

Our silly, arbritrary, (and most imporantantly, easy for me to implement) third party interaction will be with the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). 

What we'll do is get the [list of users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), and when creating a pet, if the pet's name is included in the list of usernames provided by JSON Placeholder, we'll reject the request.
