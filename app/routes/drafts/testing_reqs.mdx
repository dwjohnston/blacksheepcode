- General prop driven component testing. 
    - Pretty straight foward. 
    - The pattern applies to at any level that you are prop drilling. 
    - Can't test hooks for routes, or state management, unless you do the hook injection pattern etc. 
    - Can't/wont test loading flags 


- Page vs presentational component pattern. 

    - In this pattern, your top level page is responsible for making all the state and router hook calls, and passing those values into the presentational component. 
    - This has the advantage of retaining the prop driven pattern. 
    - At some point prop drilling is too much. 


- Do a three level page -> container -> presentational pattern? 
    - ie. Top level component is page, all it does it call any 'useRouter' type calls. 
        - Would also need to handle passing in navigation handlers? 
    - Next level is the state contianer 
    - Then presentational. 

    - I feel like this wouldn't work particularly well with any response to navigation type things. 
        - Or not? 



Test types/purposes


- 'Given this data, this stuff is displayed'
- 'When I click this, this function is called'
