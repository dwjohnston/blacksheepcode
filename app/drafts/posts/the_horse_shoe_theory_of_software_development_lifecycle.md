# The horseshoe theory of the software development life cycle

The conventional view of software development, even if one buys into the devops ethos is that the software development lifecycle looks like this: 

Product Analyst/Designer/UX Designer

Analyses what the customer wants 
Creates requirements for the developers to implement 

Developer 

Implements the requirements
Writes tests!

QA

Executes tests

Operations

Deploy artifacts to infrastructure

What I have seen frequently as a developer, is that a feature is built, and the test comes back with: 

- 




The problem being - the developer ends up being the conduit between the tester and the BA. 

## The BA and the QA should be one and the same
