# Bite Sized: 

- What works for one organisation, doesn't neceserily work for your organisation
- Accessible selectors for radio buttons/checkboxes
- Why I don't like enums in TypeScript.
- It's better for code to be testable than tested

TypeScript

- has expected fields for dealing with loose upstreams
- string to enum

Patterns of extensibility 
   - consumer opts in

Tools I like
- Whatever the menu tool is
- 

File logger

A list of phrases I'm suspicious of: 
 - 'Best practices'
 - Security concern
 - Performance concern




React bits: 

- Debug panel
- Errorable components
- Serviced componets
- Extensible content.
   - i.e a form that might have different variants. Rather than providing these variants via props, you can allow additional content to be passed as a prop and have some kind of registration function that allows intecepting the form submission event to display addition errors.

How I went about solving a problem: 

- Created scripts to create test users
- Migration to new subscripions upstream payments upstream.
   - FF at root level, rewrite the whole thing.
   - Confluence document to track things.
 
- Migration to new upstream
   - Confluence doc to ask questions, track bugs.
   - Map on to the old response.
 

## Big

I'm opposed to including state management as part of your test. 

# Things I should learn
