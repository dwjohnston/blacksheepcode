        <p>
            The text content of the blog posts is entirely written by myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use AI (Github Copilot code review) to detect and correct typos and spelling errors.
        </p>

        <p>
            I do sometimes use AI as a research tool (e.g. &apos;tell me what technologies solve X problem&apos;) and suggestions from AI may make it into a blog post. However the content and subject of blog posts always respresents my genuine thoughts, opinions or experiences on a topic; I do not use AI to suggest topic ideas.

        <p>
            Images may be AI generated - when they are, the alt text reflects it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Code snippets may or may not be generated with AI assistance; code snippets are a genuine representation the code I write in both professional and personal contexts.
