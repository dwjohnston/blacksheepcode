# How to configure NextJS to proxy its requests 

I found myself in a situation where I wanted to record the requests my NextJS application was making. Where for a straight client-side SPA I could use the network tab of the developer dev tools: 

<img src ={har.src} alt="Screenshot indicating the HAR download button in Chrome's devtools" className="blog-image" style={{maxHeight: 400, display: "block", margin: "40px auto"}}/>

For an application that involves SSR and RSCs, it's not quite this simple - as some of those requests may be made on the server side - and be simply returning the rendered HTML to the browser. 

The solution I've opted to investigate is using the tool [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), we proxy our requests through mitmproxy and and use that to record a HAR file. 

## Sample application 

I have a sample application set up at [this repository here](https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying), I'm request data in various forms from the [jsonplaceholder API.](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) 

I have four kinds of requests: 

### Straight client side requests 
<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/components/ComponentFetch.tsx#L1-L15"/>

This is the most basic, and this doesn't require special NextJS configuration - the request to jsonplaceholder is made directly from the browser, and if our browser is configured to use a proxy those requests will indeed be proxied. 


### Client side requests with rewrites 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/components/ComponentFetchRelative.tsx#L1-L13"/>

In this scenario we request the data via a relative path, and we configure NextJS to rewrite the request in the `next.config.js` file: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/next.config.mjs#L7-L16"/>

In this case the requests _won't_ be directed to our proxy, as our browser proxy configuration doesn't proxy the localhost requests. 

### Server side requests - with native fetch

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/app/page3/page.tsx#L5-L16"/>

In this scenario the request is made on the server as a RSC. We need a way to instruct our application to proxy these requests via our proxy. 

### Server side requests - with node-fetch

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/0bb4f13f98c2b5a6c51cac59669736f1a5f982ed/src/app/page6/page.tsx#L1-L15"/>

This is the same scenario but we're using node-fetch instead of native fetch. 

## Solution - use a secondary proxy

The best solution I've found is to add your own secondary proxy, and have it proxy its traffic through your target proxy.

Create a proxy server with this script:

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/proxy.js#L1-L12"/>

Update your requests, whether they're are server side requests or rewrites to reference an environment variable as the upstream. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/src/app/page3/page.tsx#L2-L3"/>
Start both your secondary proxy and NextJS application with the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env var provided. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/package.json#L7-L8"/>

Here you can see mitmproxy recording my requests!

## Alternative solutions

If the secondary proxy approach doesn't work for you, you can configure the proxying of your http client (eg. fetch or node-fetch) directly. See my [post here](./an_overview_of_configuring_proxy_behaviour_for_node_apps) for details.
