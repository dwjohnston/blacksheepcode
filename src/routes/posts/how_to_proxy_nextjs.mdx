    There may be awkward confusion around the term 'proxy' here. 
  </p>
  <p>
   If all you're needing is having your frontend relative requests (`/api/example`) redirect to a service that isn't your NextJS server, then you can use the [NextJS rewrites configuration documented here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/rewrites).

   This post pertains to proxying all requests the Next application might be making (including said rewrites) to a proxy server such as MITM proxy, while having them continue to intended destination.

I found myself in a situation where I wanted to record the requests my NextJS application was making. Where for a straight client-side SPA I could use the network tab of the developer dev tools: 

<img src ={har.src} alt="Screenshot indicating the HAR download button in Chrome's devtools" className="blog-image" style={{maxHeight: 400, display: "block", margin: "40px auto"}}/>

For an application that involves SSR and RSCs, it's not quite this simple - as some of those requests may be made on the server side - and be simply returning the rendered HTML to the browser. 

The solution I've opted to investigate is using the tool [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), we proxy our requests through mitmproxy and and use that to record a HAR file. 

## There are four kinds of requests we need to handle

I have a sample application set up at [this repository here](https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying), I'm request data in various forms from the [jsonplaceholder API.](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) 

There are four kinds of requests we need to handle.

<details>
<summary>
### Straight client side requests 
</summary>
<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/components/ComponentFetch.tsx#L1-L15"/>

This is the most basic, and this doesn't require special NextJS configuration - the request to jsonplaceholder is made directly from the browser, and if our browser is configured to use a proxy those requests will indeed be proxied. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>
### Client side requests with rewrites 
</summary>
<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/components/ComponentFetchRelative.tsx#L1-L13"/>

In this scenario we request the data via a relative path, and we configure NextJS to rewrite the request in the `next.config.js` file: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/next.config.mjs#L7-L16"/>

In this case the browser proxy configuration is not able to proxy these requests - as the requests are made to application server which is doing the requests on the browsers behalf.

<summary>
### Server side requests - with native fetch
</summary>

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/a7349693e1a8bd6e8d29800be64755062f86a070/src/app/page3/page.tsx#L5-L16"/>

In this scenario the request is made on the server as a RSC. We need a way to instruct our application to proxy these requests via our proxy. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>
### Server side requests - with node-fetch
</summary>

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/0bb4f13f98c2b5a6c51cac59669736f1a5f982ed/src/app/page6/page.tsx#L1-L15"/>

This is the same scenario but we're using node-fetch instead of native fetch. 
</details>
## Solution - use a secondary proxy

The best solution I've found is to add your own secondary proxy, and have it proxy its traffic through your target proxy.

Create a proxy server with this script:

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/proxy.js#L1-L12"/>

Update your requests, whether they're are server side requests or rewrites to reference an environment variable as the upstream. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/src/app/page3/page.tsx#L2-L3"/>
Start both your secondary proxy and NextJS application with the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env var provided. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/nextjs-proxying/blob/4f6ce764a0c02ff574c8c988bf22d08d2ea32cdf/package.json#L7-L8"/>

Here you can see mitmproxy recording my requests!

## Alternative solutions

If the secondary proxy approach doesn't work for you, you can configure the proxying of your http client (eg. fetch or node-fetch) directly. See my [post here](./an_overview_of_configuring_proxy_behaviour_for_node_apps) for details.
