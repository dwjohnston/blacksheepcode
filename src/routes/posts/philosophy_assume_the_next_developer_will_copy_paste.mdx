A core principle I keep in mind when creating a pull request is that I assume that the next developer to come along is going to continue doing what they already see here. 


## Example 1 - Switch like statements

For example, say I've written some code that looks like this: 


```tsx
type Product = {
    productType: "movie" | "book";
}

function ProductSuggestion(product: Product) {
    if(product.productType ==="movie") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/movie-icon.svg"/> Enjoy a visual spectacle with... 
        </div>;
    }

    if(product.productType === "book") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/book-icon.svg"> Jump into a great read with... 
        </div>
    }
}
```

Then we can assume that the next PR will look like this: 

```diff
type Product = {
-    productType: "movie" | "book";
+    productType: "movie" | "book" | "album";
}

function ProductSuggestion(product: Product) {
    if(product.productType ==="movie") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/movie-icon.svg"/> Enjoy a visual spectacle with... 
        </div>;
    }

    if(product.productType === "book") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/book-icon.svg"> Jump into a great read with... 
        </div>
    }

+    if(product.productType === "album") {
+        return <div> 
+            <img src="/album-icon.svg"> Rock out with... 
+        </div>
    }
}

```

## Example 2 - Tests 


## That next developer might be myself 

This is principle is not intended as indictment about the quality or the work ethic of software developers. 

Software development is complex domain, and as software developers we apply hueristics to determine what to focus on. If an area of code looks like it's working correctly, we might as well continue using that pattern. Even if a codebase sucks (see: [The Natural State of Software is Chaos](./the_natural_state_of_software_is_chaos)) it's likely not practical to rewrite every piece of code we touch as we encounter it. 

I have often found myself revisiting some code I wrote three, or six months ago, and being glad that I set up a pattern, and/or noticing that 'Oh I'm not testing this path' and then continuing in a similar manner.

The idea is, _the easiest time to get the pattern right, is the first time you write it_. 

## What of it?
