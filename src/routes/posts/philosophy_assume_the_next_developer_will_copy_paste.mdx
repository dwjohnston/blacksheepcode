  description: It's not a criticism of developers to suggest that they'll copy paste what they already see in a codebase. Programming is complex and we'll use whatever hueristic we can to reduce what we need to think about.

A core principle I keep in mind when creating a pull request is that I assume that the next developer to come along is going to continue doing what they already see here. 


## Switch like statements

For example, say I've written some code that looks like this: 


```tsx
type Product = {
    productType: "movie" | "book";
}

function ProductSuggestion(product: Product) {
    if(product.productType ==="movie") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/movie-icon.svg"/> Enjoy a visual spectacle with... 
        </div>;
    }

    if(product.productType === "book") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/book-icon.svg"> Jump into a great read with... 
        </div>
    }
}
```

Then we can assume that the next PR will look like this: 

```diff
type Product = {
-    productType: "movie" | "book";
+    productType: "movie" | "book" | "album";
}

function ProductSuggestion(product: Product) {
    if(product.productType ==="movie") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/movie-icon.svg"/> Enjoy a visual spectacle with... 
        </div>;
    }

    if(product.productType === "book") {
        return <div> 
            <img src="/book-icon.svg"> Jump into a great read with... 
        </div>
    }

+    if(product.productType === "album") {
+        return <div> 
+            <img src="/album-icon.svg"> Rock out with... 
+        </div>
    }
}

```

Whereas if our code look liked this: 

```typescript
type Product = {
    productType: "movie" | "book";
}

const productToContentMap : Record<Product['productType'], {
    image: string, 
    description: string
}> = {
    'movie': {
        image: "/movie-icon.svg", 
        description: "Enjoy a visual spectacle with..."
    }, 
    "book": {
        image: "/book-icon.svg", 
        description: "Jump into a great read with... "
    }
}

function ProductSuggestion(product: Product) {

    const content = productToContentMap[product.type];
        return <div> 
            <img src={content.image}/> {content.description}
        </div>;
}

```

then we we can expect that the next PR will look like: 

```diff
const productToContentMap : Record<Product['productType'], {
    image: string, 
    description: string
}> = {
    'movie': {
        image: "/movie-icon.svg", 
        description: "Enjoy a visual spectacle with..."
    }, 
    "book": {
        image: "/book-icon.svg", 
        description: "Jump into a great read with... "
    }
+    "album": {
+        image: "/album-icon.svg", 
+        description: "Rock out with... "
+    }
}
```

This isn't to say that, in this case,  one style is better than the other, but it's demonstrate that we can predict to some extent how a codebase is going to evolve given what we write now.
