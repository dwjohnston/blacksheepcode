import {GithubPermalinkRsc, GithubIssueLinkRsc} from "react-github-permalink/dist/rsc";

I've add the Github powered comments via [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/). 

I followed this [blog post here](https://abba.dev/blog/blog-comments-with-utterances). 

It's all pretty straightforward, here's my implementation:

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/8fc3914515be265e55b13823be5e97b4edfb0206/src/components/PostComments/PostComments.tsx#L1-L51"/>

What a fantastic tool. It took all of about 10-15 minutes to set up.
