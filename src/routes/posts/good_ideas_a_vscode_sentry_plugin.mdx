I estimate that about 90% of the 'throw new Error' lines I write are for the purpose of type narrowing, and I usually don't expect them to occur. 

For example, say I have some code like this: 

```typescript
type User = {
    id?: string; 
    userName?: string; 
  }


  function usersPath(userId: string){
    return `/users/${userId}`
  }
  
  async function deleteUser(user: User) {
  
    //Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
    //   Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2345)
    fetch(usersPath(user.id), {
      method: "DELETE"
    })
  }
  
```

We have a simple type error, user.id could be undefined. 

For the sake of argument, let's assume that we're confident that this scenario isn't going to occur.

We have a few ways we might resolve this: 

- We could add a fallback value, a la usersPath(user.id ?? "default-id")` This doesn't make sense in this scenario - this would likely just cause a random 404 error at run time when it attempts to delete a user that doesn't exist. 
- We could add a `@ts-ignore`. At runtime we would `DELETE /users/undefined` - again giving us a random 404 error. 
- We could coerce the type a la `usersPath(user.id as string)` - but this would be the same as ignoring it - we would again get a random 404. 
- We can throw an error. 

```typescript 
  async function deleteUser(user: User) {
  
    if (!user.id){
      throw new Error("Encountered an user with no id.")
    }

    fetch(usersPath(user.id), {
      method: "DELETE"
    })
  }
```


Throwing an error creates a TypeScript type guard (TODO FIND LINK), TypeScript is able to infer that the following the `throw` statement the type can no longer be undefined, and can thus treat it like a string. 

Encountering this error will be lot easier to debug than the error that will maybe result from our 404 error - now we're not going down a rabbit hole of investigating if there's something wrong with our API. 

But also remember, _we are not expecting that this scenario will actually happen_ the main reason we're throwing an error is just to appease TypeScript, and it's better to throw and error than to just ignore it. 

## What about tightening the contract? 

"Ah ha!" you say - "The real problem is that loosely typed `User` - we should make the id a required property. It's a code smell that it's optional". 

You might be right. But tightening the contract is easier said than than done. If we've got this type all through our codebase, making that type non-optional maybe no small feat. 

See my post here TODO about the living with bad codebases. 

## But there's always a chance that the error is being thrown 🤔
