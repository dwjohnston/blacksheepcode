Say you've got a git tree that looks like this 

```
A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F
```

And you want to delete commits B, C, D, E. 

You could do a

```
git rebase -i HEAD~6
```

and mark each commit to be delete, but this is pretty cumbersome - and it won't work programatically. 

In this case the `--onto` option for git rebase is useful: 

```
git rebase --onto B^ E
```

will do the trick.
