  title: Examples of tooling that do not play nicely with ESM
  description: EcmaScript Modules (ESM) are well established - leading some to argue that we no longer need to provide CJS packages. However, is that really the case?

ESM is well supported these days - so there's a question of whether we still need to be transforming our code into CJS, or whether we can leave it as nice ESM and trust that it will play nicely.

The following is a list of scenarios I have enountered where ESM packages do not play nicely out of the box. 

## 1. Jest 

Jest does not yet fully support ESM, [see this documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules).

By default, the way Jest works is: 

1. It uses Babel to transpile your code to CJS. As I understand it, it then uses these CJS modules to work its module mocking behaviour. 
2. By default, it doesn't transform the code in your node_modules - I believe this is just an optimisation. 

This means that if you have a package in your node_modules that is ESM only, when your tests run you will see an error like this: 

```
    /Users/davidjohnston/localstorage-repro/node_modules/use-local-storage-state/index.js:1
    ({"Object.<anonymous>":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,jest){import useLocalStorageState from './src/useLocalStorageState.js';
                                                                                      ^^^^^^

    SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module

      3 |
      4 | import {hri} from "human-readable-ids";
    > 5 | import useLocalStorageState from "use-local-storage-state";
        | ^
```

### The work around

Add to your `jest.config.js` this line: 

```
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['node_modules\\/(?!use-local-storage-state\\/)'],
```

to selectively opt some of your node_modules in for transformation.
