Bad meetings are probably my least favourite thing about the job. 

Here's the common scenario I see - the product owner/BA/product manager has identified a customer need, and the designer has come up with a design for the user interaction that will solve this thing. We now need to plan and build the thing - and so what I commonly see is that a meeting will scheduled that will consist of: 

- 2-3 developers,
- a project manager,
- a product manager,
- two testers,
- the designer 
- a BA.

Basically anyone who _might_ need to have an input or be informed of the decision being made are in the meeting. 

I think the reason meetings like this occur, is the thought that if someone's input _is_ required for the meeting, then they're on hand to give it, and at the same time, those who need to be informed of the decision are their hear it in real time - efficiency - killing multiple birds in one stone. Let's book an hour so we've got plenty of time to get through it all.

This is a false efficiency. 

## People who are bored aren't paying attention anyway

If the meeting is only tangentally related to 

## Large meetings are not effective at soliciting input

There are a lot of reasons why someone might be more reluctant to add their input in a larger meeting. 

- They're shy. 

- They're worried about looking ignorant in front of their colleagues. A meeting participant may be completely lost, not knowing what an XYZ-Foo is and why one is needed, and possibly other people don't know either, but they're not about to pipe up in front of fifteen of their colleagues. And if they were to pipe up, this would be wasting the time of the the colleagues who _do_ know what an XYZ-Foo is. 

- They're cognisant of people's time and attention, they don't want to waste fifteen people's time with what might be a trivial edge case (that trivial edge might be exactly the kind of input the meeting is trying to solicit!).

- They may disagree with someone in the meeting on a point, but don't want to have that disagreement in front of fourteen other people. 

In my experience, you are far more likely to get candid inputs from people in small meeting. 

## You can get into the details and not wait to 'take this offline'

Often in these large meetings, two people will be getting into the details and the phrase 'let's take this offline' will be uttered. Fair enough, we don't want to be misusing people's time. 

In a smaller meeting those details can just be gotten into. 


The nature of a meeting should change with size. The smaller the meeting, the more informal it can be, and the more input can be effectively solicited. The larger a meeting, the more formally structured it should be, the more _planned_ it should be, A large all hands with 200 people should be a rehearsed and polished experience. 

## Smaller meetings can be shorter

A smaller meeting, with a clear agenda, can just end after ten minutes, if everything is 


## How the hypothetical meeting _should_ be run 

First meeting: 

The BA, designer and one or two of the developers have a meeting, where the design is demonstrated and it's opportunity for the developers to interrogate edge cases in the design ('what should happen if that API request times out?'). 

The point of this meeting is to identify any clear holes in the design, and to act as a starting point for the developers.

The developers can also think about how the testers are going to test this thing, whether it's a straight forward thing, or whether some kind of 

Second meeting: 

At this point the developers might get together to discuss the the technical drama that they might have in building the feature. 

Third meeting: 

The developers and the testers, 




## Practical tips for better meetings

- Have an agenda. The agenda should include a timeline of checkpoints - 'At 10 minutes, Joe should be giving a brief overview of what an XYZ-Foo is and why need one. At 15 minutes, Joe will be making the case for using the Z-Zelta technique to implement our XYZ-Foo.'
Timeline the meeting such that it aims to finish at least ten minutes before the full hour, twenty minutes would be better. This will allow some overage, without having to completely cut things short. A meeting that needs to run right up to the full hour is a badly planned meeting.

- Start the meeting with the agenda.

- Adopt Jeff Bezos' meeting tip, and allocate ten or minutes at the start of the meeting to read the meeting memo. I've found this is particularly useful for sprint planning and backlog grooming meeings, where we take the time to read the ticket quietly ourselves before any discussion is done.

- Where a meeting is a 'get input from everyone' exercise - allow the creation of input in the weeks before the meeting. I've found this particularly useful for sprint retrospectives. I find often by the time the retro comes around, I've forgotten the things that were bugging me, or that were working really well. It's much easier if I can add them to the collaboration board as I encounter them. 

- The meeting host can invite people to drop off when they're no longer needed.
