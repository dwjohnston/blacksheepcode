# How to publish a React component package, using NextJS as the compiler

This is a short guide on publishing a React component library package to NPM, using NextJS as the compiler. 

## Motivation 

Your component may be a straight client component with client hooks, and as such doesn't fall in to the [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) behaviour. 

However, there are two reasons we might still want to use NextJS as our base: 

1. Server side rendering will still occur for your component, essentially the first render of the component will be rendered server side. 
2. In the future you might want to include RSCs in your component library, and so it's easier to make it work now. 

## Example code

All code for this tutorial can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling).

## Step 1: Scaffold your project using `create-next-app`

Run `npx create-next-app` and follow the prompts

## Step 2: Create a `src/library` folder and create your components 

This is where you will create your component(s) for publishing. 

Everything else will still be a regular NextJS project. You can use this as a sandbox for development, it won't be packaged for export. 

## Step 3: Create a `src/exports.ts` to export your files 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/6693d8e06152de64bc794031d6e14b601fb07f31/src/exports.ts#L1"/>

## Step 4: Add a `tsconfig.build.json`

You now have two tsconfigs, one for the regular NextJS application, and one specifically for building the package for publishing. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/6693d8e06152de64bc794031d6e14b601fb07f31/tsconfig.build.json#L1-L29"/>

## Step 5: Add build and publish scripts

At this step I also like to prefix the existing `start`, `build` scripts with `next:` - because we need to distinguish between 'build the NextJS application' and 'build the package'.  

Also, add the `main` and `files` properties to your package.json 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/6693d8e06152de64bc794031d6e14b601fb07f31/package.json#L1-L15"/>

## Step 6: Mark React a dev + peer dependency, Next a dev dependency 

The only items in your dependencies object should be things that are required for your package to run in the context it's installed. 

By marking them as dev dependencies they're available to you while developing the package but won't be needlessly installed by the application that uses it. 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/6693d8e06152de64bc794031d6e14b601fb07f31/package.json#L16-L30"/>

## Step 7: Preview your package behaviour in another application using npm link 

At this point it will be helpful to check if your package is building and configured correctly, and that another project is able to use it. 

We can use [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-link) to emulate using the package, without really publishing to NPM before we are ready. 

```
npm run build 
npm link 
```

And in the other project

``` 
npm link an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling
```

You should now be able to use the package as if it were any other package. 

## Step 8: Client components 

If you have a client component like: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/ede0876fd4406d5be8fdcb602dc9e3b755e6d59d/src/library/MyClientComponent.tsx#L1-L11"/>

With an exports folder like: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/ede0876fd4406d5be8fdcb602dc9e3b755e6d59d/src/exports.ts#L1-L2"/>

Then at this point you may be seeing this error: 

```
Error: Unsupported Server Component type: undefined
```

This appears to be a pitfall with RSCs and NextJS [see this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75261466/unsupported-server-component-type-undefined-next-js-13).

The resolution is to export either your RSCs or your client components separately, like: 


<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/9d67e42e38b1018a51d2d0b2d9cc3f26a3016e8f/src/export-client.ts#L1-L2"/>

and be sure to add this new exports file to your `tsconfig.build.json` 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/blob/9d67e42e38b1018a51d2d0b2d9cc3f26a3016e8f/tsconfig.build.json#L24-L27"/>

and then have users import the component like: 

```js
import {MyComponent } from "an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling";
import {MyClientComponent} from "an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling/dist/export-client";
```

## Step 9: npm publish

Run npm publish and see your published package!

This package is published [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/an-example-react-package-built-with-nextjs-tooling).


## Addendum: Add other tooling you want to use

At this point you could add tools like [Storybook for NextJS](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/nextjs), or set up your unit tests etc.
