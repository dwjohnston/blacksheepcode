import { ImagePanel } from "@/components/ImagePanel/ImagePanel";

<ImagePanel images={{

Images are good for blogs. 

It's nice to have a social preview that isn't the regular site logo, and images serve to break up the screen and have the reader not be faced with a wall of text. 

I'm also not anti-AI, I quite happily use AI to generate code. 

I don't use AI to write any of my blog content, that seems dishonest and weird, and AI always has a kind of 'samey' feel to it. 

In the past I might use a google search to find free-to-use images, but that's always been a less than satisfying task - it's hard to find relevant images. 

AI-generated images pose an easy solution to this - I can quickly and easily generate images that are relevant to the content, it'll break up the walls of text and the blog will look better.

But, I'm concerned that it'll tarnish the blog. It might look good in the moment for each individual blog post, but sometime down the track - the blog will have this samey look of 'yet-more-ai-slop-everywhere'.

What say you? How do you think about this?
