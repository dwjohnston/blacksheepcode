  title: How to create a responsive React hook to listen for changes to cookies
  description: Your React components may wish to listen for changes to made to cookies, whether they were made by other React code, or HTTP requests or non-React JavaScript. The CookieStore API can help.

I recently encountered a situation where I have some React code that needs to listen for changes to a cookie, but this cookie logic isn't controlled React. 

Some searches reveal tutorial posts like [this one](https://seraj.me/blog/useCookie-hook) that implement a `useCookie` hook. 

This works kind of nicely, we get a nice `useState` style hook, that also stores into cookies as a side effect, it's helpful for retainining state between sessions. 

However, this solution is not responsive to cookie changes that may occur _outside_ of the React context. In fact, two components that were examining the same cookie would not have their updates be observed by the other. 

<DemoFrame
  description={
    <>
    <p>Click the 'Update User' button and observe the value changes.</p>
    <p>Open your browser dev tools.</p>
    <p>Observe that when you click 'Update User' a `user-1` cookie is set in the Applications tab.</p>
    <p>Observe that when you click 'Server Fetch' an API call is made, and that Response contains a cookie. However our application will not respond to this cookie.</p>
    </>
  }
>
  <UserProfile1/>
</DemoFrame>

The scenarios where cookies may be set outside of a React context are: 

- Cookies being set by HTTP responses
- Cookies being set with JavaScript in your state management layer

We can use the [`CookieChangeEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieChangeEvent) to make a `useCookie` hook truely responsive. 

<InfoPanel level="warning">
<p>The [`CookieStore`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) is not currently supported by Firefox or Safari.</p>
<p><span>I couldn't a CookieStore polyfill. There is the [`cookie-store`](https://github.com/markcellus/cookie-store) project - but this has not implemented the CookieStore Monitoring Cookies feature. See this issue:</span> <GithubIssueLinkRsc issueLink="https://github.com/markcellus/cookie-store/issues/46" variant="inline"/></p>
<p>My solution implements the polling solution described in [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63952971/1068446)</p>
<p>Note that on a page refresh the values in the demo are blank. This is to avoid hydration errors - this solution solves for cookies on the client-side only. The cookies are available to the server - a solution that avoids this flash will be the job of seperate post. </p>

The a polyfilled implementation of a responsive useCookie looks like this: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/cookies-and-react/blob/bdb11e2edd944c0b67c64e63a674a6a1e73a89ca/src/hooks/useCookieWithListenerPolyfilled.ts#L12-L133"/>



<DemoFrame
  description={
    <>
    <p>Using Chrome observe that our component now responds to cookies set by the api response</p>
    <p>Observe that this also works for Firefox. It appears sluggish - this is due the 1000ms poll rate. You can decrease the poll rate for snappier application, this will come at the cost of extra computation for the user.</p>
