I recently encountered a situation where I have some React code that needs to listen for changes to a cookie, but this cookie logic isn't controlled React. 

Some searches reveal tutorial posts like [this one](https://seraj.me/blog/useCookie-hook) that implement a `useCookie` hook. 

This works kind of nicely, we get a nice `useState` style hook, that also stores into cookies as a side effect, it's helpful for retainining state between sessions. 

However, this solution is not responsive to cookie changes that may occur _outside_ of the React context. In fact, two components that were examining the same cookie would not have their updates be observed by the other. 

<DemoFrame
  description={
    <>
    <p>Click the 'Update User' button and observe the value changes.</p>
    <p>Open your browser dev tools.</p>
    <p>Observe that when you click 'Update User' a `user-1` cookie is set in the Applications tab.</p>
    <p>Observe that when you click 'Server Fetch' an API call is made, and that Response contains a cookie. However our application will not respond to this cookie.</p>
    </>
  }
>
  <UserProfile1/>
</DemoFrame>

The scenarios where cookies may be set outside of a React context are: 

- Cookies being set by HTTP responses
- Cookies being set with JavaScript in your state management layer

We can use the [`CookieChangeEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieChangeEvent) to make a `useCookie` hook truely responsive. 

<InfoPanel level="warning">
<p>The [`CookieStore`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) is not currently supported by Firefox or Safari.</p>
<p><span>I couldn't a CookieStore polyfill. There is the [`cookie-store`](https://github.com/markcellus/cookie-store) project - but this has not implemented the CookieStore Monitoring Cookies feature. See this issue:</span> <GithubIssueLinkRsc issueLink="https://github.com/markcellus/cookie-store/issues/46" variant="inline"/></p>
<p>My solution implements the polling solution described in [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63952971/1068446)</p>
<p>Note that on a page refresh the values initially show as 'John Doe' and then cookie value pops in. This is because this blog is has server rendering, and this these solutions access the client cookies.  Cookies are available to the server - a solution that avoids this flash [is available in this post here](./server_side_responsive_cookies_for_react). </p>

The a polyfilled implementation of a responsive useCookie looks like this: 

<GithubPermalinkRsc permalink="https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/blob/755c91364f8673ccec472ec8fb2c883f1d324f71/src/demos/responsive_cookies/hooks/useCookieWithListenerPolyfilled.ts#L1-L131"/>

<DemoFrame
  description={
    <>
    <p>Using Chrome observe that our component now responds to cookies set by the api response</p>
    <p>Observe that this also works for Firefox. It appears sluggish - this is due the 1000ms poll rate. You can decrease the poll rate for snappier application, this will come at the cost of extra computation for the user.</p>
