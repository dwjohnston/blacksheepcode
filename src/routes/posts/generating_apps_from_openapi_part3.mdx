# Generating apps from OpenAPI specs - Part 3 - Generating MSW API mocks using msw-auto-mock 

A commonly suggested approach for testing frontend code is to use a tool like [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to mock your HTTP requests. 

In this post, we'll demonstrate usage of the tool [msw-auto-mock](https://github.com/zoubingwu/msw-auto-mock) to achieve this, and save us writing screeds of mocking logic ourselves. 

All code for this example can by found [here](https://github.com/dwjohnston/open-api-go-and-typescript/commit/40a8a5676abe1ca6040684dc1079da4a6c0c9f5d). 

## Our component 

```tsx 
export const DisplayPetById = (props: DisplayPetByIdProps) => {
  const {  } = props;


  const petQuery = usePet(props.petId); 

  return (
    <div>
      {petQuery.isLoading && "...loading"}
      {petQuery.isError && "Error!"}
      {petQuery.data && <>
        Pet Name: {petQuery.data.name}
      </>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

We have a simple component here. That `usePet` looks like this: 

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { petsApi } from "../services/petsService";

export function usePet(petId:number){

    return useQuery({
        queryFn: () => petsApi.findPetById({ id: petId}),
        queryKey: ["pet", petId],
    }); 
}
```

We're using react-query to provide loading flags etc, and we're using that service function that created in our earlier post. 

## The Test

We make sure we have included an example in our OpenAPI definition: 

```diff
//Pet.json 
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "id",
    "name"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "integer",
      "format": "int64"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string", 
+     "example" : "Fido"
      
    },
    "tag": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}

```

We can now run: 

```
msw-auto-mock ../spec/petstore-separate/spec/swagger.json \
 -o src/generated/msw.js --base-url '/api'
```

And hey presto, all of the MSW boiler plate is created in that `msw.js` output file we generated. 

Our test: 

```tsx
import React from 'react';

// We have our render method which includes the react-query provider
import {render} from "../testUtils/testRender";
import {screen} from "@testing-library/react";
import {DisplayPetById} from './DisplayPetById';
// Import handlers from the generated MSW boilerplate
import {handlers} from "../generated/msw";
import { setupServer } from 'msw/lib/node';

const server = setupServer(...handlers);

describe(DisplayPetById, () => {


    beforeAll(() => {
        // Establish requests interception layer before all tests.
        server.listen()
      })
      afterAll(() => {
        // Clean up after all tests are done, preventing this
        // interception layer from affecting irrelevant tests.
        server.close()
      })

  it("Renders without error", async () => {
    render(<DisplayPetById  petId={1}/>)


    expect(screen.getByText("...loading")).toBeInTheDocument(); 

    // The pet name is based on the example we set in the OpenAPI definition!
    expect(await screen.findByText("Pet Name: Fido")).toBeInTheDocument(); 


  }); 
});

```


Brilliant!

msw-auto-mock does not currently support multiple examples, which might make this limiting for more comprehensive testing. In that case you might need to get creative and/or extend the functionality of what msw-auto-mock is providing.
