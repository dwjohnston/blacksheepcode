---

Summary: 


- AI is really good at spell checking. It makes me feel a bit guilty for using AI in such an extravagent manner. 
- There's a sense that AI can serve fairly effectively as duct taping some process that could easily be solved, but you haven't got around to yet. 

- Treat AI like an enthusiastic junior developer - but one with no integrity and really wants a payrise. 
- The problem with AI is that it's not very good at saying 'I don't know' or 'This isn't a great solution'. 
- It doesn't disagree with you. If I were asking a senior developer these tasks, I feel like they would be more effective at coming back and getting me to agree with a delivery plan. 
 - Possibly this is all stuff that I can configure AI to do. 

- At least for my time strapped purposes - AI doesn't really solve the problem of not having enough time to do the thing - because reviewing the AI's code is still time consuming. 
   - It might be time saving overall, but it's not a panacea. 
   - ... unless you were to start merging AI generated code blindly. 


- AI is waaaaay to verbose. 







https://github.com/dwjohnston/blacksheepcode/pull/219

Summary: Asked AI to fix all the typos. 

Result: âœ… Brilliant. Really good at this kind of task. 


https://github.com/dwjohnston/react-github-permalink/pull/60

Summary: Asked it to create Stack Overflow links. 

Result: It did a pretty good first pass. The actually output was pretty crappy, but the boiler plate is there. 

Similary PRS:

https://github.com/dwjohnston/react-github-permalink/issues/74

Summary: Asked it to create the documentation. 

What I was hoping for here is the boilerplate CSS etc. 

Result: Man it's verbose. 

With a lot of this stuff, where it's not critical path code, it's easy to say 'yip good enough' and then you can see how a bunch of superflous CSS could be added and then it not be clear what its purpose is. 




https://github.com/dwjohnston/matrix-action-runs/pull/2
Summary: This here is me getting it to some very simple boilerplate. 

Result: It's pretty good at it.  Still too verbose, but not so much that it's hard for me to pare down. 




https://github.com/dwjohnston/vibe-coded-nemon/pull/2

Summary: I created an issue asking it to create an old DOS game I played. 

Something has gone wrong with it, where as the result of the feedback it now thinks its fixing bugs? 

What was annoying about this is that it half implemented the thing, and either I didn't read its (overly verbose) PR description properly, or it hid the fact. 

The game certainly didn't work right first go.

This is in IDE copilot. 

I often give it the component interface and ask it to implement it, which it does a reasonable job, the code works. 

It does write some pretty crappy code at times! (Or is it? Is this actually quite a good way to effectively 'cancel' the previous query?)

Here's me cleaning it up: 

https://github.com/dwjohnston/example-react-autocomplete/commit/e7342740a23b935132e399021ae535b3e0e0e7ff#diff-42a831359684503af2249bcc0c1875414d41c89b853f3dd619cccdb447528eac




https://github.com/dwjohnston/vscode-sentry-plugin/pull/2

I have no idea if this works or not. I have not checked it out, have not run it. 

Demonstrates how easy it is to ask the AI to do something, but that that doesn't mean that I'm going to be able to use it.
