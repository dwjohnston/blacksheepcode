My blog. [https://blacksheepcode.com/](https://blacksheepcode.com/)

Markdown files, turned into a blog with NextJs. 

## Running it yourself: 

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

If you're editing blog posts, you will need to run `npm run generate:all` between changes. 

## Features

There is a build time step that extracts FrontMatter meta data out of the MDX files, and that's how the social previews and tagging and series functionality works. 

The comments are via Utterances. 

See the posts here for details about how the blog works: https://blacksheepcode.com/posts?tag=blogging
